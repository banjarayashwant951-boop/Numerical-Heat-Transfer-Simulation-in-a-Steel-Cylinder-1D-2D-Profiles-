# Heat Transfer Simulation

This project focuses on simulating and analyzing **heat transfer profiles** under different boundary conditions using numerical methods.

## Overview
The study includes:
- **Steady-State Simulation**: Solved 2D elliptic heat conduction equations to determine equilibrium temperature distributions.  
- **Transient Simulation**: Modeled 1D parabolic heat conduction to capture time-dependent temperature profiles until equilibrium.  
- **Comparative Analysis**: Visualized and compared steady-state vs. transient results to estimate equilibrium temperature maps and time required to reach steady state.

## Features
- Simulation of **1D transient** and **2D steady-state** heat conduction.  
- Analysis under **varied boundary conditions** (Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed).  
- Visualization of temperature evolution and steady-state distributions.  
- Estimation of **time-to-equilibrium** from transient solutions.  

## Tools & Methods
- **Numerical Methods**: Finite Difference Method (FDM) for solving parabolic and elliptic PDEs.  
- **Programming**: MATLAB 
- **Visualization**: Temperature profiles plotted for comparison across cases.  

## Results
- Generated steady-state temperature maps for 2D domains.  
- Captured transient temperature evolution in 1D systems.  
- Identified equilibrium distributions and calculated time to steady state.  

## Applications
- Thermal system design and optimization.  
- Educational demonstration of heat conduction principles.  
- Benchmarking for numerical PDE solvers.
